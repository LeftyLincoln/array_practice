# Self Evaluation

1. I am feeling pretty good with arrays so far. While I would not say I am working quickly, I progressed through the assignment well.
2. I would like to practice working on more boolean arrays, as that tripped me up a little bit, on what to store in the array.
3. I am curious about the functionality of all the methods and which ones developers end up using the most.
